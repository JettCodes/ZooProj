        It’s frigid and you’re surrounded by ice. You wonder how any animal could <br>

    Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds.<br>
    They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere:<br>
    only one species, the Galápagos penguin, is found north <br>
    of the Equator. Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins<br>
    have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming.
