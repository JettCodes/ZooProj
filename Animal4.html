        Marine habitats are habitats that support marine life. <br>
        Marine life depends in some way on the saltwater that is <br>
        in the sea. A habitat is an ecological or environmental <br>
        area inhabited by one or more living species. The marine <br>
        environment supports many kinds of these habitats. <br>

        The giant clams are the members of the clam genus Tridacna<br>
        that are the largest living bivalve mollusks. There are actually<br>
        several species of "giant clams" in the genus Tridacna, which are <br>
        often misidentified for Tridacna gigas, the most commonly intended <br>
        species referred to as "the giant clam".<br>
