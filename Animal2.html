<h2>Desert Habitat</h2>
<p>
    <q cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/nature/habitats/article/desert">
        Deserts are the driest places on Earth—they get fewer than 10 inches (25<br>
        centimeters) of rain a year. Some deserts may get a lot of rain all at once.<br>
        Then it might not rain again for months—or even years!

         <br>
         A camel is an even-toed ungulate in the genus Camelus that bears<br>
         distinctive fatty deposits known as "humps" on its back. Camels <br>
         have long been domesticated and, as livestock, they provide food<br>
         and textiles.

    The fennec fox is a small crepuscular fox native to the deserts of North Africa,<br>
    ranging from Western Sahara to the Sinai Peninsula. Its most distinctive feature<br>
    is its unusually large ears, which serve to dissipate heat and listen for underground<br>
    prey. The fennec is the smallest species of fox.
